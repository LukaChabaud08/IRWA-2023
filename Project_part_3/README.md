# Part 3: Ranking

In this third part of the project, we kept the same python notebook structure as the previous two parts of the project.

## Getting Started

For executing the notebook, you will need to use a development environment like [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Make sure you have one before continuing.

Make sure you also have downloaded and decompressed the file called "IRWA_data_2023.zip"

### Running the Notebook

To run the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook with your favorite environment.

2. Check the imports by running the first cell. If you're missing any of the imports, install the packages using
```bash
pip install <package>
```
3. Change the paths of the data if needed. In the case you don't load the data from google drive, skip the cell where drive is mounted.

4. You can now run the cells in the notebook and interact with the code.
